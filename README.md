# Artificer Attackspeed based Cooldown

Scales Artificer's cooldowns to 75% of her attack speed. Based on Withor's "A" mod. I reduced the scaling to 75% because a linear reduction appeared to be too OP. 75% ensures that she doesn't get too over-powered until at least looping once.

## Changelog

**1.1.10**
Added config options for reduction percentage and whether to apply only to primary skill.

**1.0.0**

* Initial release.
